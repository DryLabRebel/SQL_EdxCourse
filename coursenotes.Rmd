Welcome Video:

  - not bad

SQL a language used for querying data in a relational database

SQL and databases are absolutely everywhere.

I hope the whole course isn't just a bunch of videos. If I wanted to watch videos I'd just use YouTube right?

### How to create a Database Instance on a Cloud ###

- You need a database before you can practise SQL

- We're going to create an instance of this on a cloud

This lesson:

- basic database concepts
- list a few cloud databases
- describe database instances
- demonstrate how to create an instance

#### Databases ####

A cloud database is a database service built and accessed through a cloud platform

It works like any traditional database, but with the flexibility of cloud platforms

Advantages of cloud computing:

- Ease of use
  - clouds are accessible from anywhere using a vendors API or web interface
- Scalability
  - cloud databases can expand or shrink their capabilities depending on client needs
- Disaster recovery
  - multiple backups of data are kept secure across remote servers worldwide

Cloud Databases:

- IBM Db2 on Cloud,
- PostgreSQL on IBM Cloud, 
- Oracle Database Cloud Service,
- Microsoft Azure SQL Database, and
- Amazon Relational Database Services. 

These cloud databases can run in the cloud either as a virtual machine.

They can be single or multi-tenant depending on the plan.

Running a database:

- provision an instance of a database

This gives you access to the database cloud resources without having to set up the underlying hardware.

Basically you can have a databse without need to buy all the gear yourself and get it all set up and maintaining it (could put people like David out of a job!)

The db service will hold your relational tables.

Once your data has been stored you can connect, and can then interface using SQL queries.

Your SQL statements are sent to the database instance, the instance then "resolves the SQL statements into operations against the data and objects in the database. Any data
retrieved is returned to the application as a result set" - i.e. you will send a query, and it will return a result to your browser/API whatever.

Wow, well that was just a huge stuff around. Very poorly explained video, took me ages to get to where I needed to get to.

This course is going to take a really long time at this rate.

So I just navigated to the IBM cloud site, created an account, and spent quite some time getting to the same point as the video. It was very poorly explained, and the video is a series of screen shots, which makes it difficult.

I hope the whole course isn't like this.

Now I can't even remember how I did it. But after stuffing around for a while, I somehow eventually ended up on the page that the tutorial appeared to be on, and eventually got to the console section it directed me too, but oops, I have to create service credentials, which are in a different section (don't get confused!).

I eventually created my service credentials:

I feel like I should save this somewhere else, and not save it to GitHub. Seems important.

Done.

### Relational Datbase Concepts ###

This video:

- advantage of relational model
- describe how an entity name and atributes map to a table
- difference between an entity and an attribute
- identify common data types
- describe the function of primary keys

#### Relational database ####

- the most used data model
- allows for data independence
- data is stored in tables

Entity relationship data model is an alternative to a relational data model

Entity model is used to design the relational database?

Entities are nouns: person, place, thing

- drawn as rectangles
- entities contain attributes (ovals) which provide information about the entity
- attributes are connected to exactly one entity
- the entity becomes a table in the database (makes sense)
- columns becomes the attributes

Entity:
attribute attribute attribute attribute 

for columns which vary in length: varchar
for columns which dont vary: char

Primary key uniquely identifies each row (tuple!), preventing duplication

Foreign keys - primary keys defined in other tables - allow linking of information

I pretty much know all this already, but it's nice to be refreshed on the specific details.

There's also a few different conventions, it would be good to try to memorise important stuff like 'varchar' and 'char', and other data types.

OK, so the next step is a step by step guide to creating an IBM db2 account and instance, which I've already struggled through.

To their credit, it appears that the practical is a much clearer guide through the process.

NOTE: - I should just watch all the videos and try to take notes, and see if practicals clear things up a bit at the end!
  - This should save me some time

So I can't actually take the assessemnts unless I upgrade!!
  - Which means I either upgrade now, or I come back later and do the assessments - after I've probably forgotten everything already!
  - Gah!

Think about this today and decide tomorrow.

- Do another 1 - 2 modules (then you'll be halfway through geez)
  - Keep taking notes
  - If you're confident the course will get you what you want, then go for it
  - Otherwise you need to find a way to showcase your skills
    - Use them to build your database
    - Keep track of the code you use and push it to GitHub

Module 2
--------

Learning objectives

- How to write basic SQL statements
- Practise them in a live database (save these and push to GitHub)

### Create a Table ###

Database objects:

Entities = tables
Attributes = columns
Tuples = Rows

#### Data definition language statements ####

DDL are used to define, change or drop database objects

CREATE - creating data tables, defining columns
ALTER - altering tables - adding dropping columns, modifying data types
TRUNCATE - deleting data in a table, but not the table itself
DROP - deleting tables

Are all data

#### Data manipulation language statements ####

Read and modify data in tables

- CRUD - create, read, update, delete

INSERT - inserting data
SELECT - reads or selects data
UPDATE - updates data in a table
DELETE - deletes data from a table

```{sql}
CREATE TABLE table_name
  (
  column_name_1 datatype optional_parameters,
  column_name_2 datatype,
  ...
  column_name_n datatype
  )
```

```{sql}
CREATE TABLE author
(
author_id CHAR(2) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
lastname VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
firstname VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
email VARCHAR(4) NOT NULL,
city VARCHAR(15),
country CHAR(2)
)
```

[//]: # ( This all feels terribly redundant. I learned all this exactly a year ago, and I learned it faster than this )
[//]: # ( It's OK, just keep going quickly through - see how it goes, it may get better/more technical later on - You'll still be able to get the certificate )
[//]: # ( I'm sure if I just kept working on my Music data base, I'd continue to pick up concepts faster than this )
[//]: # ( I just need to do a good job of ensuring that I have these requesite skills, and can demonstrate them to employers )

### SELECT statement ###

select is a DML (data manipulation language) statement

- read and modify data

select * from 'tablename'

e.g.:

```{sql}
SELECT book_id, title FROM book
```

To add a condition (i.e. a specific type of book), use WHERE

```{sql}
SELECT book_id, title FROM book WHERE book_id='B1'
```

[//]: # ( Just changed to a Rmd doc, so now blocks have syntax highlighting. Much better )

Ah... I think I see now, the blue ones are DDL statements and the green ones are DML statements. Well I guess this course is teaching me something afterall.

---

count() allows you to select a specific number of rows

```{sql}
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tablename

```

for example:

```{sql}
SELECT COUNT(COUNTRY) FROM medals WHERE country='CANADA'
```

distinct is used to remove duplicate values

```{sql}
SELECT DISTINCT COUNTRY FROM medals WHERE medaltype='gold'
```

limit - for restricting the number of rows retrieved

```{sql}
SELECT * FROM medals LIMIT 10
```

```{sql}
SELECT * FROM medals WHERE YEAR = 2018 LIMIT 10
```

### INSERT statement ###

DML statement

Used to insert data into a table (duh!)

```{sql}
INSERT INTO AUTHOR
(AUTHOR_ID, LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME, EMAIL, CITY, COUNTRY)
VALUES 
('A1', 'Chong', 'Raul', 'rfc@ibm.com', 'Toronto', 'CA')
```

Multiple rows can be inserted at once.

```{sql}
INSERT INTO AUTHOR
(AUTHOR_ID, LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME, EMAIL, CITY, COUNTRY)
VALUES 
('A1', 'Chong', 'Raul', 'rfc@ibm.com', 'Toronto', 'CA')
('A1', 'Ajhuv', 'Tim', 'AT@ibm.com', 'Toronto', 'CA')
('A1', 'Johnson', 'Paul', 'PJ@ibm.com', 'Toronto', 'CA')
('A1', 'Chong', 'Rick', 'RC@ibm.com', 'Miami', 'FL')
```

### UPDATE and DELETE statements ###

Used to modify data in a table

Syntax of update statement:

    UPDATE [TableName] SET [[ColumnName]=[Value]] 

Syntax of delete statement:

    DELETE FROM [tablename] WHERE [condition]

So there are '5 basic SQL statements'. Seems simple enough.
